# hello-world
Hi, I'm Johnathan Wells. I am a fourth year General Music and Computer Science with a focus in 
Data Structures. My primary coding languages right now are Python and C++, however I am familiar 
with Java as well and more than willing to learn a new language at any time.

Below are two branches, one branch is full of different Kattis problems (open.kattis.com), while the other has a few other projects from school or personal interests.
